When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.  
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).  
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.  
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
